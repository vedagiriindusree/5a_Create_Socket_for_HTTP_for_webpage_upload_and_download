## AIM :
To write a PYTHON program for socket for HTTP for web page upload and download
## Algorithm
1.Start the program.
2.Get the frame size from the user.
3.To create the frame based on the user request.
4.To send frames to server from the client side.
5.If your frames reach the server it will send ACK signal to client otherwise it will send NACK signal to client.
6.Stop the program.
## Program 
```
import socket

def send_request(host, port, request):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((host, port))
        s.sendall(request.encode())
        response = s.recv(4096).decode()
    return response

def upload_file(host, port, filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
        file_data = file.read()
        content_length = len(file_data)
        request = f"POST /upload HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {host}\r\nContent-Length: {content_length}\r\n\r\n"
        request += file_data.decode()
        response = send_request(host, port, request)
    return response

def download_file(host, port, filename):
    request = f"GET /{filename} HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {host}\r\n\r\n"
    response = send_request(host, port, request)
    # Assuming the response contains the file content after the headers
    file_content = response.split('\r\n\r\n', 1)[1]
    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(file_content.encode())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    host = 'example.com'
    port = 80

    # Upload file
    upload_response = upload_file(host, port, 'example.txt')
    print("Upload response:", upload_response)

    # Download file
    download_file(host, port, 'example.txt')
    print("File downloaded successfully.")
```

## Result
Thus the socket for HTTP for web page upload and download created and Executed
